## Advanced Data Analytics Techniques

This repository contains the work from Task 6 of my internship, focusing on advanced data analytics techniques. The goal is to apply sophisticated statistical and analytical methods to address complex problems, with an emphasis on time series analysis, sentiment analysis, text mining, and clustering or classification techniques.

### Project Overview

1. **Time Series Analysis for Forecasting**  
   **Objective:** Forecast trends and analyze seasonality in time-dependent data.  
   **Techniques Used:** ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Seasonal Decomposition, and other time series models.  
   **Tools:** Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, etc.)

2. **Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining**  
   **Objective:** Extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.  
   **Techniques Used:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis using both lexicon-based and machine learning approaches.  
   **Tools:** Python (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, etc.)

3. **Clustering and Classification Techniques**  
   **Objective:** Explore segmentation and pattern recognition in data.  
   **Techniques Used:** K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
